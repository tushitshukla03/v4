In India, it is considered to be “weak” to approach a mental counselor. So many people in need of help hesitate to seek help and thereby improve their situation. Not addressing this may lead the person to enter a downward spiral.What we propose is to gamify the experience of seeking help, through small tasks that give reward points on completion. Awarding points act as a positive feedback.
